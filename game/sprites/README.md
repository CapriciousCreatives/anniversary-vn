# Sprites

This directory is meant for character sprites. Every character should have a range of sprites for certain emotions. Make sure to add characters to their appropriate subfolders and clearly label the character CGs by their expression as provided by the [organization document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zSJ7i0sE0r0wtrprqqspfrqGVYtTVrbeuwOdbAWQzd4/edit#gid=226301752).
Please respect the following parameters for each sprite:

* Character sprites will be ~1000 pixels in height on screen. Higher res images are fine, make sure to use [Ren'py's oversampling feature](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/displaying_images.html#oversampling)
* Unless there are serious encoding issues, try to use the **.webp** image format whenever possible to keep the overall filesize of the project low for faster deployment times
