    petra "Losing all of your memories…" 

    # Can we insert a ''Flashback'' here? Like show screenshots or images of previous scenes throughout the day? I was thinking of screenshots of the time Nina greeted Petra in the morning, screenshot of the moment where Ember was nibbling on her fish hair clip, all of them having breakfast together, then Petra seeing the flower patch present. It's supposed to be like, Petra suddenly remembering good memories, thinking about her own set of memories she doesn't want to forget.
